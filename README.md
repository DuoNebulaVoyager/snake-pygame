# Snake Eater (Remix)

This is a remix of a snake game written in Python by [rajatdiptabiswas](https://github.com/rajatdiptabiswas) using the Pygame library. Two snakes duke it out to see who can get the biggest. 


## Installing
Download the Python 3 installer package from the official website and install it, if not installed previously.

Run the following in the terminal to install the Pygame library
```
pip3 install pygame
```


## Running the application
Download the source code from the repository and run the file just as any other Python script (.py) file.
```
python3 Snake\ Game.py <difficulty>
```

<difficulty> is a parameter that changes the tick rate of the game. If you have a higher difficulty, the tick rate increases, and consequently the snakes get faster, which makes the game more difficult. 

## Prerequisites
